# Code Editor with Recommendation System Project

Welcome to the repository for the Code Editor with a Recommendation System project! This project aims to create a code editor for Python, Java, and C++ with advanced features, including a recommendation system, split-screen functionality, and integration with the ChatGPT API.

## Project Description üß†

This code editor is a versatile development environment for Python, Java, and C++. It incorporates the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for the user interface.
- **Code Functionality**: CodeMirror is integrated to provide code editing features.
- **Automatic Restart**: Nodemon is used to automatically restart the application when file changes in the directory are detected, preserving cache data during code compilation.

## Project Goals üéØ

This project is a challenging endeavor that offers a valuable learning experience. The primary objectives are:

1. **Recommendation System**: Implement a recommendation system similar to VS Code. It should suggest upcoming statements as users write code.

2. **Split Screen Concept**: Create a split-screen layout, with one side displaying the code editor and the other side showing questions or prompts. Users can adjust the frame size according to their needs.

3. **MERN Stack Integration**: Transition the project into a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack to facilitate the split-screen concept, making it easier to manage and render content dynamically.

4. **Syntax Highlighting**: Add syntax highlighting by changing the color of functions, variables, or reserved words, similar to VS Code, for improved code readability.

5. **Integration with My DSAlgo Website**: Incorporate the code editor into your existing DSAlgo website, allowing users to practice coding alongside your educational content.
